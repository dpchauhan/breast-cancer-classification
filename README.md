# Machine Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis
Can we accurately distinguish cancerous cell?


# Problem Description
Breast Cancer (BC) is a common cancer for women around the world, and early detection of BC can greatly improve prognosis and survival chances by promoting clinical treatment to patients early. So itâ€™s amazing to be able to possibly help save lives just by using data, python, and machine learning!
In some cases, it is difficult to distinguish certain benign masses from malignant lesions with mammography.So our task to classify that the beast contains benign cell or malignant cell.
